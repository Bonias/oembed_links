This is the oembed_links gem.  It allows you to easily parse text and
query configured providers for embedding information on the links
inside the text. A sample configuration file for configuring the
library has been included (oembed_links_example.yml), though you
may also configure the library programmatically (see rdocs).



To get started quickly (in irb):

require 'oembed_links'
OEmbed.register({:method => "NetHTTP"},
                {:flickr => "http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed/"},
                {:flickr => { :format => "xml", :schemes => ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/*"]}})
OEmbed.transform("This is my flickr URL http://www.flickr.com/photos/bees/2341623661/")



To get started quickly in Rails:

Copy the included oembed_links_example.yml file to RAILS_ROOT/config/oembd_links.yml,
add a dependency to the gem in your environment.rb ( config.gem "oembed_links" )
and start your server.  That's it.




See the rdocs for much more complete examples.  The specs directory has some examples of programmatic
use, but the test to code ratio is slim atm.

Thanks to the Indianapolis Star I&D department for open sourcing this; most notably Chris Vannoy for giving the okay.
